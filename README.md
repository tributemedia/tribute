## Pantheon Contrib Workflow

All commits should be done against dev, do not commit to master.

1. Create a multidev in Pantheon. Work on and complete your changes here.
2. Once completed, get the changes from the multidev synced into your local repository, and create a commit.
3. Push your changes to the global repo.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all your planned changes are complete.
5. You, or another team member, should create a pull request to the main branch once all planned changes for the version are complete. 
6. A code review will take place to review features about to be pushed out to all sites, and to review the quality of code. If approval is given, the pull request is merged into main.
7. A release is created by a repo maintainer, and then the changes will be available to all!
